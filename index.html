                    <span class="projectlanguage">PYTHON PROJECT 1 :</span>
                    <p class="text">Tic Tac Toe is a classic two-player strategy game that has entertained people for generations.<br>
                        The game is played on a 3x3 grid where players take turns marking a square with their respective symbols—X or O.
                         The objective is simple: be the first player to align three of their symbols in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.<br><br>
                        This project showcases my implementation of Tic Tac Toe in Python, demonstrating my programming skills and understanding of game logic. 
                        The game features two modes: a two-player mode where users can compete against each other and a bot mode where players can challenge a computer opponent. 
                        Throughout this portfolio, I will explore the various components of the game, provide insights into the code structure, 
                        and share video demonstrations of gameplay.
                    </p>
                    <h3 class="subtitle">Game Features</h3>
                    <p class="text">The Tic Tac Toe game includes the following key features to enhance the user experience:<br><br>
                        <strong>Two-Player Mode:</strong> In this mode, two players can compete against each other by taking turns 
                        to enter their moves. The game prompts players to input their desired row and column, and the board is updated in 
                        real time. The game checks for a winner after each move, ensuring an engaging experience until either player wins 
                        or the game ends in a draw.<br><br>
                        <strong>Bot Mode:</strong> Players can choose to play against a bot, which adds an extra layer of challenge. 
                        The bot uses a simple strategy to make its moves, checking for winning opportunities and blocking the player's 
                        moves when necessary. This mode allows players to practice their skills against a computer opponent.

                    <p class="text">The Tic Tac Toe implementation in Python consists of several key functions, each responsible for a 
                        specific part of the game's functionality.<br> 
                        To further illustrate the key components of the Tic Tac Toe code, I have included several screenshots highlighting
                         important sections and their functions. Each screenshot is accompanied by an explanation to clarify its role within the overall implementation.<br>
                         Below is an overview of the main components of the code:<br><br>

                        board to the players. It prints the grid layout, including the numbers representing each cell, 
                        and updates the display after each move.<br> 
                        This function enhances the user experience by providing a clear visual representation of the game.

                        It evaluates all possible winning combinations: three rows, three columns, and two diagonals. 
                        If any of these combinations contain the same player's symbol, the function returns True, 
                        indicating a win.<br>

                        The function includes validation to ensure that the input is valid, checking for correct

                        The bot first checks if the center cell is available; if so, it occupies that space. 
                        Then, it evaluates the board for any winning opportunities or potential blocks against the human player. 
                        If neither condition is met, the bot chooses the first available cell, ensuring the game continues smoothly.

                        It initializes the game by asking players to choose their mode (against another player or the bot) 
                        and sets up the board. The function contains the main game loop, which alternates turns between players, 
                        checks for victory or a full board, and updates the game state accordingly.<br>

                    <h3 class="subtitle">Error Handling</h3>
                    <p class="text">Error handling is a crucial aspect of the Tic Tac Toe game, 
                        ensuring a smooth user experience and preventing crashes due to invalid input.
                         The game includes several mechanisms to manage potential errors:
                    </p>
                    <ul class="listtext">
                        <li class="listtext"><strong>Input Validation: </strong>The player_move function incorporates robust input validation. 
                            It checks that the player's input consists of exactly two characters and that both characters are numeric. 
                            If the input is not valid, the function provides informative feedback, prompting the player to try again 
                            with the correct format.
                        </li>
                        <li class="listtext"><strong>Range Checking: </strong>
                            After confirming that the input is numeric, the function checks if the entered row and column numbers 
                            are within the valid range (0 to 2). If the numbers are outside this range, the player is informed, and 
                            they are asked to enter valid coordinates.
                        </li>
                        <li class="listtext"><strong>Occupied Cell Handling: </strong>
                            During gameplay, if a player attempts to occupy a cell that is already filled, 
                            the game checks the board state and notifies the player that the selected square is not available. 
                            This prevents invalid moves and ensures that the game remains fair and enjoyable.
                        </li>
                    </ul>                  
                    <p class="text">These error handling mechanisms contribute to a user-friendly experience, 
                        allowing players to focus on the game without being frustrated by unexpected issues. 
                        By providing clear instructions and feedback, the game enhances player engagement and 
                        enjoyment.
