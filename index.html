                    <span class="projectlanguage">PYTHON PROJECT 1 :</span>
                    <p class="text">Tic Tac Toe is a classic two-player strategy game that has entertained people for generations.<br>
                        The game is played on a 3x3 grid where players take turns marking a square with their respective symbolsâ€”X or O.
                         The objective is simple: be the first player to align three of their symbols in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.<br><br>
                        This project showcases my implementation of Tic Tac Toe in Python, demonstrating my programming skills and understanding of game logic. 
                        The game features two modes: a two-player mode where users can compete against each other and a bot mode where players can challenge a computer opponent. 
                        Throughout this portfolio, I will explore the various components of the game, provide insights into the code structure, 
                        and share video demonstrations of gameplay.
                    </p>
                    <h3 class="subtitle">Game Features</h3>
                    <p class="text">The Tic Tac Toe game includes the following key features to enhance the user experience:<br><br>
                        <strong>Two-Player Mode:</strong> In this mode, two players can compete against each other by taking turns 
                        to enter their moves. The game prompts players to input their desired row and column, and the board is updated in 
                        real time. The game checks for a winner after each move, ensuring an engaging experience until either player wins 
                        or the game ends in a draw.<br><br>
                        <strong>Bot Mode:</strong> Players can choose to play against a bot, which adds an extra layer of challenge. 
                        The bot uses a simple strategy to make its moves, checking for winning opportunities and blocking the player's 
                        moves when necessary. This mode allows players to practice their skills against a computer opponent.

                    <p class="text">The Tic Tac Toe implementation in Python consists of several key functions, each responsible for a 
                        specific part of the game's functionality.<br> 
                        To further illustrate the key components of the Tic Tac Toe code, I have included several screenshots highlighting
                         important sections and their functions. Each screenshot is accompanied by an explanation to clarify its role within the overall implementation.<br>
                         Below is an overview of the main components of the code:<br><br>

                        board to the players. It prints the grid layout, including the numbers representing each cell, 
                        and updates the display after each move.<br> 
                        This function enhances the user experience by providing a clear visual representation of the game.

                        It evaluates all possible winning combinations: three rows, three columns, and two diagonals. 
                        If any of these combinations contain the same player's symbol, the function returns True, 
                        indicating a win.<br>

                        The bot first checks if the center cell is available; if so, it occupies that space. 
                        Then, it evaluates the board for any winning opportunities or potential blocks against the human player. 
                        If neither condition is met, the bot chooses the first available cell, ensuring the game continues smoothly.

                        It initializes the game by asking players to choose their mode (against another player or the bot) 
                        and sets up the board. The function contains the main game loop, which alternates turns between players, 
                        checks for victory or a full board, and updates the game state accordingly.<br>

                    <h3 class="subtitle">Error Handling</h3>
                    <p class="text">Error handling is a crucial aspect of the Tic Tac Toe game, 
                        ensuring a smooth user experience and preventing crashes due to invalid input.
                         The game includes several mechanisms to manage potential errors:
                    </p>
                    <ul class="listtext">
                        <li class="listtext"><strong>Input Validation: </strong>The player_move function incorporates robust input validation. 
                            It checks that the player's input consists of exactly two characters and that both characters are numeric. 
                            If the input is not valid, the function provides informative feedback, prompting the player to try again 
                            with the correct format.
                        </li>
                        <li class="listtext"><strong>Range Checking: </strong>
                            After confirming that the input is numeric, the function checks if the entered row and column numbers 
                            are within the valid range (0 to 2). If the numbers are outside this range, the player is informed, and 
                            they are asked to enter valid coordinates.
                        </li>
                        <li class="listtext"><strong>Occupied Cell Handling: </strong>
                            During gameplay, if a player attempts to occupy a cell that is already filled, 
                            the game checks the board state and notifies the player that the selected square is not available. 
                            This prevents invalid moves and ensures that the game remains fair and enjoyable.
                        </li>
                    </ul>                  
                    <p class="text">These error handling mechanisms contribute to a user-friendly experience, 
                        allowing players to focus on the game without being frustrated by unexpected issues. 
                        By providing clear instructions and feedback, the game enhances player engagement and 
                        enjoyment.

                    <h3 class="subtitle">Summary of Learning</h3>
                    <p class="text">Creating the Tic Tac Toe game was a valuable experience that enhanced my 
                        understanding of programming concepts such as game logic, user input handling, and condition 
                        checking. I learned how to implement a turn-based game where two players (or a player and a 
                        bot) can interactively play against each other.<br> 
                        One of the biggest challenges I faced was ensuring that the game logic correctly handled 
                        various scenarios, such as detecting victories, handling invalid moves, and maintaining a 
                        smooth flow of the game. I overcame these challenges by systematically debugging the code 
                        and testing it, which helped me identify areas needing improvement.<br> 
                        Additionally, I gained experience in implementing a simple bot, which involved conditional 
                        checks to determine winning moves and blocking the player's potential victories.<br> 
                        This reinforced my understanding of algorithmic thinking and how to structure decision-making 
                        processes within a program.

                    <h3 class="subtitle">Future Improvements</h3>
                    <p class="text">Looking ahead, there are several potential improvements 
                        I would like to make to enhance the Tic Tac Toe game:
                    </p>
                    <ul class="listtext">
                        <li class="listtext"><strong>Enhancing the Bot's Intelligence: </strong>Currently, the bot follows a basic strategy 
                            of winning or blocking the player's moves. I would like to implement a more sophisticated algorithm, 
                            such as the Minimax algorithm, which would allow the bot to analyze all possible future moves and choose 
                            the optimal one. This would make the game more challenging for players.
                        </li>
                        <li class="listtext"><strong>Adding a Graphical User Interface (GUI): </strong>
                            While the text-based interface is functional, creating a GUI using a framework like Tkinter or 
                            Pygame would significantly improve the user experience. 
                            A visual representation of the game board would make it more engaging and intuitive for players.
                        </li>
                        <li class="listtext"><strong>Implementing Different Game Modes: </strong>
                            I could introduce additional game modes, such as playing against another bot with varying difficulty
                             levels, or even a multiplayer mode where players can compete online.
                        </li>
                        <li class="listtext"><strong>Statistics and Leaderboards: </strong>
                            Adding functionality to track player wins, losses, and draws could provide players with feedback on 
                            their performance. A leaderboard would encourage competitive play and give a sense of achievement.
                        </li>
                        <li class="listtext"><strong>Customizable Game Rules: </strong>
                            Allowing players to adjust the size of the board (for example, 4x4 or 5x5 grids) or even changing 
                            the winning condition (e.g., needing four in a row) could provide variety and replayability.
                        </li>
                    </ul>                  
                    <p class="text">By implementing these improvements, I aim to create a more robust, engaging, and enjoyable Tic Tac Toe game.

                    <p class="text">The Jinx Fansite is designed with several key features that not only enhance user experience 
                        but also showcase my coding skills and design choices. My specific focus was on creating an engaging layout 
                        and informative content for the fansite2.html page, which includes the following components:<br>
                        <br>
                        <strong>Character Overview:</strong> The fansite begins with an introduction to Jinx, 
                        structured using semantic HTML tags like h1 for the main title and p for paragraphs. This approach improves SEO and accessibility, 
                        ensuring that fans can quickly grasp Jinx's background and significance within the League of Legends universe.
                        <br><br>
                        <strong>News Section:</strong> I implemented a dynamic news section utilizing div containers to organize updates 
                        related to Jinx, including game updates, new skins, and appearances in the Arcane series. 
                        By using CSS Flexbox for layout, I ensured that the news items are responsive and visually appealing,

                        that showcases stunning images and videos of Jinx in action. 
                        I employed a grid layout using CSS to ensure that the media is displayed in an organized and visually appealing 
                        manner. This enhances the immersive experience for fans, allowing them to interact with Jinx's character through 
                        multimedia.
                        <br><br>
                        <strong>Links to Social Media and Other Fan Sites:</strong> I integrated links to Jinx's official social media profiles using a tags, 
                        encouraging fans to connect and follow her on various platforms. 
                        This not only fosters a sense of community but also directs traffic to related fan sites, 
                        expanding the network of Jinx enthusiasts.
                        <br><br>
                        <strong>Contact Form:</strong> I designed a user-friendly contact form using form elements, allowing fans to 
                        reach out with inquiries or feedback. This feature is crucial for fostering communication and building a sense 
                        of community among fans. By utilizing form validation and accessible labels, I ensured that the form is user-friendly.

                        In summary, the design and coding techniques employed in the Jinx Fansite are purpose-driven, enhancing user 
                        experience, engagement, and accessibility. Each feature was carefully crafted to serve the needs of the fans 
                        while showcasing my skills in HTML, CSS, and responsive design.
